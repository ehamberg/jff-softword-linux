This Linux port was done by Erlend Hamberg <ehamberg at gmail>.

This is pretty much a 1:1 port, I have just ripped out the Win32 API code and
replaced it with SDL code and fixed case-sensitivity issues. I guess it's
possible to reduce the executable size by stripping it and using an executable
packer such as upx.

When just running it with ./softworld, the intro will run in fullscreen in
640x480 (32 bpp), but you can change this with the following switches:
--windowed              - run in windowed mode
--resx XRES             - set width
--resy YRES             - set height
--16                    - 16 bpp

To build the intro you need these libraries (development versions):
* SDL
* OpenGL
* GLU

Have fun, and don't hesitate to send me an email me if you have any comments or
problems.
